Today's meeting mostly dealt with the question of what does freshness mean for situations where Evidence is collected by the lead attester, but verified by the lead verifier, such as class 1.
The Evidence could be ancient, from the last boot, but the Freshness might be more recent.
We discussed situations where a freshness nonce could be shared by A with the components, and when this might be desired, and when it might be forbidden.

Ned: Freshness is an attribute of the authentication layer rather than the attestation layer.  It's a property of the connectivity, and when connectivity fails (due to a reboot of a component), then that automatically ends freshness for previous interation.

next meeting Nov. 24.
